# Hangman

A python gaming script that responds to various inputs from a user, thus creating a space for the user to play a tradition solo hangman game.

By using Tkinter and PyGame, the game is able to present a clean looking interface. Tkinter was used to control a large bulk of the program, from displaying different texts and images to responding to different inputs given by the user. PyGame was primarily used to control the music. 

I am currently working on a way to give the user an option to play against a bot.
